# Metadata and Documentation with AnalysisBar Chart: "Top 10 Most Frequent Areas of Origin for Fire Incidents"
Dataset:

Name: Fire Incidents
Source: City of Toronto Open Data Portal
Description: This dataset includes only fire incidents as defined by the Ontario Fire Marshal (OFM) up to December 31, 2023. It provides detailed information about fire incidents to which Toronto Fire Service (TFS) responds. The data includes information on the area of origin, building status, business impact, civilian casualties, and other related variables.
Variables Used:

Area_of_Origin: The specific area within a property where the fire originated (e.g., Cooking Area or Kitchen, Porch or Balcony).
Frequency: The count of fire incidents that originated from each area.
Estimated_Dollar_Loss: The estimated financial loss caused by the fire incidents, in dollars.
Civilian_Casualties: The number of civilian casualties, including fire-related injuries and fatalities.
Transformations and Calculations:

Data Cleaning: Rows with missing values in the 'Area_of_Origin', 'Estimated_Dollar_Loss', and 'Building_Status' columns were dropped.
Imputation: Missing numerical values were filled with the median value of the respective columns. Missing categorical values were filled with the mode.
Selection: The top 10 areas of origin with the highest frequency of fire incidents were selected for the visualization.
Visualization:

Software Used: Plotly Express (Python)
Purpose: To highlight the most common areas of origin for fire incidents in Toronto and the associated estimated dollar loss.
Design Choices:
Color Scale: 'Plasma' color scale based on 'Estimated_Dollar_Loss' to visually differentiate areas with varying financial impacts.
Axes Labels: Clearly labeled axes for 'Area of Origin' and 'Frequency of Incidents'.
Title: A descriptive title indicating the focus of the visualization.
Grid Lines: Light grey grid lines to enhance readability.
Annotations: Hover data to provide additional information on estimated dollar loss and civilian casualties.
Analysis of Results:
The bar chart reveals that the most frequent area of origin for fire incidents is the Cooking Area or Kitchen, with a significantly higher frequency compared to other areas. This is followed by Porch or Balcony and Sleeping Area or Bedroom. The high frequency in kitchens can be attributed to the common use of heat sources and cooking appliances, which are potential ignition sources. The visualization also highlights that the Cooking Area or Kitchen has the highest estimated dollar loss, indicating that fires originating in this area tend to cause substantial financial damage.
