# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
## A "Good" Example of Visualization
Link: https://www.behance.net/gallery/17868143/Power-grid

Name: Power grid in Hong Kong

### Accessibility
1.1. Visual Clarity: The visualization employs a flowchart to depict the distribution and consumption of electricity in Hong Kong, along with additional elements like heavy users and electricity tariffs. 
However, the use of similar color shades and small text can be challenging for viewers, particularly those with visual impairments or color blindness. 

1.2. Text and Labels: The font size for detailed labels and data points is relatively small, which can be difficult to read. Increasing the font size and ensuring adequate contrast between text and background would enhance accessibility.

1.3. The visualization does provide some context at the top, explaining the current energy scenario in Hong Kong, which helps orient the viewer. However, more detailed explanations directly associated with specific data points could improve understanding.

### Reproducibility
2.1. The visualization does not provide a detailed methodology for how the data was collected or processed. This lack of transparency makes it challenging to verify the accuracy of the information or reproduce the analysis.

### Equity
3.1. Comprehensive Breakdown: The visualization includes a comprehensive breakdown of electricity generation, consumption, and tariffs, which seems inclusive. However, it lacks discussion of the socio-economic implications of energy use and distribution, which could 
provide a more balanced view.

3.2. Potential Bias: Without specific socio-economic context, there may be an implicit bias in how electricity consumption and tariffs are perceived. For example, the representation of "heavy users" could be interpreted without understanding the necessity or efficiency of their energy use.

## A "Bad" Example of Visualization

Link: https://vizualize.tumblr.com/post/120177748652/via-the-human-toll-of-fifas-corruption-the

Name: An unprecedented death toll in Qatar

### Accessibility
1.1. Visual Representation: 

a. The visualization effectively uses icons to represent deaths, but it lacks text that clarifies the scope and context of the data.

b. There is limited information about the context or reasons behind the figures, which might be necessary for some audiences to fully understand the implications.

c. The icons are presented in different shades of red, which could be problematic for color-blind individuals. 

1.2. Font Size and Legibility:

a. The text in the visualization, particularly the labels and the source citation, appears to be quite small. This can be challenging for viewers with visual impairments or those viewing the chart on smaller screens. 

b. The color of the font, if it is not sufficiently contrasting with the background, can make it difficult to read. A lack of contrast can especially affect viewers with color vision deficiencies. 

### Reproducibility
2.1.  The chart does not provide the raw data or a detailed methodology, which are critical for reproducibility. Without access to the underlying numbers and the criteria used for counting deaths, others may find it challenging to replicate the exact findings.

2.2.  The visulization does not specify whether the data covers all construction-related deaths or only those related to specific events and limits the ability to reproduce or verify the findings.

### Equity:
The potential bias in the visualization arises from not clearly stating the context, reasons for the deaths in Qatar, and lacking specific details such as the time period and the exact number of deaths.  Without clear information about the period, the industries involved, and the broader socio-economic conditions, viewers may overlook other contributing factors to the situation.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
## A "Good" Example of Visualization
### Accessibility
1.1. Visual Clarity: Enhance color differentiation by using more distinct shades or patterns to distinguish between different data points, especially for viewers with color vision deficiencies. Consider using a color-blind friendly palette.

1.2. Text and Labels: Increase the font size of labels and data points to enhance readability. Ensure that the text color contrasts well with the background, using high-contrast color schemes to improve visibility for all viewers, including those with visual 
impairments.

1.3. Context and Explanations: Add more detailed explanations directly next to specific data points or sections of the chart. This could include annotations or tooltips that explain key figures or trends, helping viewers understand the significance of the data in the broader context.

### Reproducibility
2.1. Include a section or an annotation that cites the data sources used and describes the methodology for data collection and analysis. Providing links to the original data sets, if publicly available, or a brief overview of how the data was processed, would enable others to verify the findings and recreate the visualization.

### Equity
3.1. Comprehensive Breakdown: Include information on the socio-economic implications of energy distribution and consumption, such as the impact of tariffs on different income groups or regions. This context would provide a more balanced view, helping viewers understand the broader effects of energy policies.

3.2. Potential Bias: Clarify the roles and responsibilities of different sectors in energy consumption. For instance, provide insights into why certain sectors are heavy users (e.g., essential services, industrial requirements) and discuss efficiency measures or policies in place. This additional context can help mitigate misinterpretation and ensure that the data is viewed within an appropriate framework.

## A "Bad" Example of Visualization

### Accessibility
1.1. Visual Representation:

a. Ensure that the visualization includes text explanations that clarify the data's scope, such as specifying whether it covers construction-related deaths broadly or deaths specifically linked to major events.

b. Provide more context about the data, including potential contributing factors or conditions that have led to the reported deaths.

c. Use patterns or shapes along with colors to differentiate data points, accommodating viewers with color vision deficiencies.

1.2. Font Size and Style:

a. Use a readable font typeface, such as Arial or Verdana, at a minimum of 12 points to enhance readability. 

b. Ensure that the font color contrasts strongly with the background to improve readability. 

c. Include descriptive alt-text for all visual elements, especially for online versions of the visualization. Alt-text should describe the key information and insights provided by the visualization, making it accessible to screen readers and individuals with visual impairments.

### Reproducibility
2.1. Clearly outline the sources of data, including the raw data itself, and provide a detailed methodology explaining how the data was collected and interpreted.

2.2. Specify whether the data includes all construction-related deaths or is focused on deaths related to specific events. 

### Equity
2.1. Clearly indicate the timeframe during which the data was collected for Qatar, if the data covers migrant worker deaths from 2010 to a specific year, state this explicitly.

2.2. Detail the specific areas or industries in which these deaths occurred. For instance, if the deaths are related to construction projects, infrastructure development, or specific event preparations (such as the World Cup), this should be clearly noted.

2.3. Ensure that the visualization does not imply causation or specific reasons for the deaths without proper evidence. If the data is primarily associated with a specific event or industry, clarify this, and consider including notes on broader conditions or systemic issues that may also contribute to the situation.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization.
