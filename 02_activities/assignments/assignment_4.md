# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify:
## Bar chat "Top 10 Most Frequent Areas of Origin for Fire Incidents"
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    I used Plotly Express to create the data visualization.
    
    > Who is your intended audience? 
    The intended audience for this visualization includes fire safety officials, urban planners, policymakers, and the general public. This audience is interested in understanding the common areas where fire incidents originate to improve safety measures, allocate resources effectively, and raise public awareness.
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    The message of the visualization is to highlight the top 10 most frequent areas of origin for fire incidents responded to by the Toronto Fire Service (TFS) up to December 31, 2023. The aim is to inform stakeholders about the most common locations of fire incidents, the frequency of these incidents, the estimated dollar loss, and civilian casualties associated with them.
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
    - Substantive: The data presented is relevant and directly related to fire safety. It includes meaningful metrics such as the frequency of incidents, estimated dollar loss, and civilian casualties.
    - Perceptual: The use of a bar chart ensures that the differences in frequencies are easily perceivable. The color gradient based on estimated dollar loss helps in quickly identifying the severity of incidents.
    - Aesthetic: The plot uses a clean, white background with contrasting colors to enhance readability. Titles, labels, and annotations are clearly legible with an appropriate font size and style. The color palette 'Plasma' provides a visually appealing and distinguishable gradient.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    To ensure reproducibility, I used Python scripts with libraries such as Plotly, Pandas. These scripts can be shared and run in any Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed, ensuring that others can recreate the visualization with the same dataset.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    To enhance accessibility, I:
    - Used high-contrast colors for better visibility.
    - Included descriptive labels and annotations to provide context.
    - Ensured that the font size is large enough for easy reading.
    - Provided interactive elements (hover data) that allow users to explore additional details without cluttering the main visualization.
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    - Residents of areas frequently affected by fires, as they may take preventive measures.
    - Fire safety officials and policymakers, who can use the information to implement targeted fire safety campaigns and allocate resources more effectively.
    - Urban planners and building inspectors, who can incorporate findings into building codes and safety regulations.
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    I included features that are most relevant to understanding the context and impact of fire incidents:
    - Included: Area of Origin, Frequency, Estimated Dollar Loss, and Civilian Casualties. These metrics provide a comprehensive overview of the common areas of origin, their frequency, financial impact, and human toll.
    - Excluded: Detailed temporal data, exact coordinates, and other less relevant attributes to maintain clarity and focus on the key message.
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    - Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset was free from missing or inconsistent values.
    - Preprocessing: Aggregating data to focus on the top 10 most frequent areas of origin.
    - Testing: Running multiple iterations of the visualization to ensure clarity, accuracy, and aesthetics.
    - Troubleshooting: Resolving issues related to software dependencies, exporting images, and ensuring interactive elements function as expected.
    - Documentation: Writing clear, reproducible code and annotations for others to understand and replicate the visualization process.
    
- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
